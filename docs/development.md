# wondertrader: development workflow and layout

Use branch `feature/ayu_develop`. The actual upstream default branch and all fetched branch/tag identities are recorded in the maintenance sync evidence. Merge existing work; do not reset divergent branches or replace conflicting tags.

## Source synchronization

```sh
git fetch origin
git fetch upstream
git switch feature/ayu_develop
git merge origin/feature/ayu_develop
# Merge the actual default branch documented in the sync result.
```

This maintenance used namespaced remote tags before comparing tag identities. Missing upstream tags/branches were pushed to the fork; divergent branches were merged when conflict-free, and conflicting identities were retained for explicit reconciliation. The feature branch contains the default branch plus the maintenance changes. Source snapshot and architecture are documented in [ayu-develop.md](ayu-develop.md).

## Repository layout

- `docs/ayu-develop.md` and `docs/ayu-develop.html`: engineering guide with architecture, workflow, class and sequence diagrams and implementation links.
- `docs/development.md`: toolchain, layout and contributor workflow.
- `docs/validation.md`: exact executed commands, outcomes and limitations.

## Native Linux build

Use the repository's official Linux/amd64 Docker image and bundled `docker/mydeps_gcc8.4.0.7z` dependency archive. CMake builds all targets. GCC8 links `stdc++fs` only where required. Existing unit tests run on Linux-local storage so LMDB uses normal filesystem locking. The host macOS CMake attempt is recorded separately from the successful Linux build.

## Verification and documentation

Use the commands and results in [validation.md](validation.md). Markdown is the editable source of the guide; HTML embeds rendered SVG diagrams for offline browsing. Keep actual source links valid after moving modules. Preserve existing cases/assertions while correcting incompatible APIs, genuine resource leaks or invalid fixtures. No additional test cases were requested or added.
